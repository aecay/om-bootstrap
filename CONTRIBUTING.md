# Contributing

Contributions to Om-Bootstrap are very welcome. (Thanks to the Schema project for the template for these contributing guidelines.)

Please file bug reports on [GitHub](https://github.com/racehub/om-bootstrap/issues).

For questions, feature requests, or discussion, please post on the Clojure [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojure) for now.

Contributions are preferred as GitHub pull requests on topic branches.  If you want to discuss a potential change before coding it up, please post on the mailing list.

Om-Bootstrap is relatively well-tested on ClojureScript.  Before submitting a pull request, we ask that you:

 * please try to follow the conventions in the existing code, including standard Emacs indentation, no trailing whitespace, and a max width of 95 columns
 * rebase your feature branch on the latest master branch
 * ensure any new code is well-tested, and if possible, any issue fixed is covered by one or more new tests
 * check that all of the tests pass
